tagger.py — Apply friction/nudge codebook to tourism text.

DESIGN RATIONALE: KEYWORD MATCHING, NOT ML
------------------------------------------
This module deliberately implements friction (フリクション / 摩擦) tagging as
transparent, rule-based keyword matching rather than a trained classifier.
The trade-off is explicit:

  - Precision/recall: a supervised or LLM classifier would likely achieve
    higher recall (paraphrases, misspellings, implicit complaints) and
    possibly higher precision. Keyword rules miss anything not in the
    codebook vocabulary and can fire on figurative usage.
  - Traceability: every single tag produced here can be traced to a specific
    keyword line in config/friction_codebook.yaml and reproduced exactly —
    the system is deterministic, auditable, and explainable to a thesis
    examiner with no model weights, prompts, or training-data provenance to
    defend. For an academic instrument this auditability was judged to
    outweigh the recall ceiling.

Crucially, tagger accuracy is not assumed. Keyword coverage, denominator
selection, and manual audit limitations bound every downstream result.

MATCHING RULES
--------------
Codebook is loaded from config/friction_codebook.yaml.
Keyword matching uses word-boundary regex (case-insensitive), so 'bus' does
not fire inside 'business'. Multi-word phrases are matched as-is (spaces
preserved).

Compound keywords: a keyword containing '&&' (e.g. 'stairs && steep')
requires ALL of its sub-keywords to appear somewhere in the text
(co-occurrence, any order/distance). This lets the codebook use broad,
high-recall words while recovering precision through required co-occurrence.

Negation handling (negation-aware matching): if a negation word (not, less,
never, wasn't, etc.) appears within a 4-word lookbehind window before a
keyword match, the match is suppressed. This matters for English text,
where praise is routinely phrased through negated friction vocabulary —
"not crowded at all", "wasn't busy", "less crowded than Kyoto" — which a
naive keyword matcher would mis-tag as waiting_crowding friction. Keywords
that themselves BEGIN with a negation word ('no food', 'not worth') encode
the negation intentionally and bypass the lookbehind check.

    Compound keywords ('&&' co-occurrence operator):
      - If keyword contains '&&', all sub-keywords must match somewhere in
        text (each independently negation-checked, any order, any distance).
        Rationale: a single broad word like 'stairs' or 'busy' would be
        high-recall but low-precision; requiring co-occurrence ('stairs &&
        steep', 'busy && too') recovers precision while keeping the
        individual words broad. This is the codebook's only composition
        mechanism, kept minimal on purpose so every rule stays auditable.

    Keywords that begin with a negation word (e.g. 'no food', 'not worth',
    'nowhere to eat') encode negation explicitly — the negation IS the
    friction signal, so the lookbehind suppression is skipped for them.
    All other keywords (single- or multi-word) are subject to negation checking,
    so 'not too crowded' does not match 'too crowded'.

    Every occurrence of the keyword is examined (finditer): one negated
    occurrence does not veto a later non-negated occurrence elsewhere in the
    same text.
